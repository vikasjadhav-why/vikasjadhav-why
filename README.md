- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vikasjadhav-why
and I am interested in learning about the world around us thorugh Physics. Studying things having to do with gravity brings me a lot of delight.
Rather than just pen and paper calculations, I love using semi-analytic techniques to study and model the world around us.

Feel free to contact me.
